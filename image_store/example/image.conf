# 
# This file describes an image. This would typically contain information 
# or directives that would help provisioning operation. 
#
# One can add any variables that suite their data center environment as
# well as image being provisioned. 
#
# When a variable is introduced here, typically provisioning script would 
# also be used to consume it.
#
# Please read the sample provision.sh in this directory which contains
# psedo code explaining how provisioning script might use the variables 
# described below
# 
# 
# The information in the image.conf is read by convirt UI. The user can 
# change any value specified here for a particular provisioning operation. 
# ConVirt would create new instance of configuration that contains 
# modifications done by user. This new file is provided to the provisioning 
# script (provision.sh)
# 
# Syntax : python syntax

# Installer kickstart approach

# kernel and ramdisk locations 
# These variables can point to the url (http/ftp) or networked file location 
# where the kernel and ramdisk that kicks off the instller can be downloded 
# from.

# example
#kernel_src='/net/images/fc5/vmlinuz'
#ramdisk_src='/net/images/initrd.img'

# example1
#kernel_src='ftp://ftp.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/fedora/linux/core/5/i386/os/images/xen/vmlinuz'
#ramdisk_src='ftp://ftp.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/fedora/linux/core/5/i386/os/images/xen/initrd.img'
# 

kernel_src=
ramdisk_src=


# Location to create new disk VBDs
VM_DISKS_DIR='/var/cache/convirt/vm_disks'

# Location of conf file
VM_CONF_DIR='/var/cache/convirt/vm_configs'


#
# kickstart file for silent install
#
# kickstart file can be specified as kernel parameter. This is achived by
# adding 'ks=<location of ks file>' in the extra field in the xen config
# file. So if you wish to use this, add it to xen_config_template
#


# Another common approach is to have pristine disk images available as
# populated VBDs or content of the disk in some archived format 
# like zip, tar, tar_gzip 
# 
# The provisioning script in the VBD case would simply copy the file
# while in the latter case, would create vbd/lvm, format the disk, and
# copy the content from the source archive.
# 
# Note : Each variable is using device name as a prefix, thus allowing
#        each disk to be provisioned differently

# example
# hda_image_src='/net/template_images/fedora.gzip'

# location of pristine image
hda_image_src=

# Type of pristine image, can be disk_content or disk_image
# disk_image : just copy the file with potential name change
# disk_content : contains actual files on the disk.
#                a. create disk
#                b. use the disk_fs_type to create file system
#                c. copy the content to the destination (after mounting)
#    
#example :
#hda_image_src_type='disk_image'
hda_image_src_type=

# format in which we have the source disk content.
# possible values are tar, tar_gz, tar_bz2, zip, dir
#
#example :
#hda_image_src_format='tar_gz'
hda_image_src_format=


# specify the file system the disk should be prepared with ext2/ext3
# TBD : Add variables required for supporting cow files
# example 
# hda_disk_fs_type='ext3'
hda_disk_fs_type=

#
# Specify if disk is to be created or not. 'yes'/'no'
#
hda_disk_create=

#
# Specify the disk type LVM and VBD are supported by current create_disk
# you can write your own create disk and pass specific type here.
#
hda_disk_type=

#
# Specify the disk size in MB
#
hda_disk_size=

#
# if you have another disk then u might use
#
hda1_disk_create='yes'
hda1_image_src=
hda1_image_src_type=
hda1_image_src_format=

hda1_disk_size=
hda1_disk_size=
hda1_disk_fs_type=

#OR
hdb_disk_create='yes'
hdb_image_src=
hdb_image_src_type=
hdb_image_src_format=

hdb_disk_type=
hdb_disk_size=
hdb_disk_fs_type=


#
# Special handling required for swap disk/partition like, updating fstab
# 
# Hint, that we need/have a swap partition
# Values 0 or 1
# example : swap=1
swap=

# swap type : a separate disk or partition in one of the existing disk
# Values : disk or partition
# Example : swap='disk'
swap_type=

#identify the swap disk/device
#exemple: swap_disk='hda1'
swap_disk

#
# nfs root mounting params
#
# Please specify the nfs root related paramters in the xen_config_template
#




# Additional parameters that might be used by provisioning script
# or customization scripts
#
# These are just examples 
#

firewall='on'
admin_user='admin'
admin_password='$1$9qAFryp3$XmvqcFN/CJG4AC7jgyVE8'
admin_group='admin'
